# Final Project

In my IBM Data Analyst Professional Capstone project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst tasked with conducting comprehensive data analysis for the company. This involved gathering data from diverse sources, conducting exploratory data analysis, performing data wrangling and preparation, executing statistical analysis, and mining the data for insights. I also created various charts, plots, and an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics to visualize the findings.

The primary objectives of the analysis were to identify future skill requirements, determine the top programming languages and database skills in demand, and highlight the most popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

At the conclusion of the project, I compiled a presentation summarizing the key findings of the data analysis report. This presentation was tailored to various stakeholders within the organization, including Human Resource and IT department heads.
